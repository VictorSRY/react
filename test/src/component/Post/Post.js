            <p>Apple had launched its iPhone SE 2020 last month with a starting price of Rs. 42,500 in India. But there was no word on the availability of the device in India. Now a Flipkart listing has confirmed that Apple iPhone SE 2020 sale will start in India from May 20 via Flipkart at 12PM. Notably, HDFC Bank recently announced a instant discount offer that brings the effective price of the iPhone SE (2020) 64GB variant down to Rs. 38,900 and this offer will be available via Flipkart. The new Apple phone is powered by the A13 Bionic SoC and packs a single 12-megapixel camera at the back</p>
